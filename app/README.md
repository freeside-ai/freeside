# app

The SwiftUI multiplatform client: the macOS + iOS attention inbox, decision detail, and run timeline. Client databases are disposable read caches; the daemon is sole authority, and both platforms use the same sync API (see `docs/plan.md` §5.14).

**Bootstrap exemption** (plan §5.7): SwiftUI work in this directory does not flow through the Freeside pipeline until a macOS execution class exists (deferred, possibly forever). Go work joins the pipeline only once Freeside manages its own repo, the bootstrap test that follows the deliberately boring first repository (plan §11); this component may never join it.

- **Toolchain:** Xcode / Swift Package Manager.
- **Scope boundary:** client-side code only. The daemon/client contract is defined in `api/`; client code consuming it lives here, never in `api/`. No JS toolchain enters this component.
- **Status:** empty until Phase 1A, which includes the minimal macOS/iOS clients (plan §11, build order step 2). Per-component build/test/run commands land in `AGENTS.md` with this component's first PR.
