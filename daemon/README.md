# daemon

`freesided`, the Go daemon: event inbox, workflow engine, signet (attention service), StageDriver and ReviewSource, ward (runner layer), gauntlet (hostile import and clean verification), git/publish service, store, and sync API. It owns workflow state and all credentials; clients are thin (see `docs/plan.md` §5.1, §5.2).

Daemon CI builds and tests on **Linux as well as macOS from day one**: the daemon core takes no Apple-only dependencies, making portability continuously verified rather than aspirational (plan §3.3).

- **Toolchain:** Go (single static binary, supervised by launchd/systemd, dedicated user). Module `github.com/freeside-ai/freeside/daemon`, pinned in `go.mod`; build/test/run commands are in `AGENTS.md`.
- **Scope boundary:** daemon-side code only. The daemon/client contract is defined in `api/`; server-side code implementing it lives here, never hand-authored to diverge from the spec.
- **Status:** initialized in Phase 1A (Wave 0 unit 1). `internal/` holds one placeholder package per lane (`signet`, `export`, `importer`, `verify`, `publish`, `ward`, `domain`, `engine`); each lane's real code lands with its Wave unit.

## Testing conventions

**Golden files.** Tests that assert a serialized shape compare it against a
committed fixture rather than hand-writing the expected bytes inline. Use the
shared helper `internal/golden` so every lane's golden tests share one shape
and one regeneration switch:

```go
import "github.com/freeside-ai/freeside/daemon/internal/golden"

func TestRender(t *testing.T) {
    got := render(input)          // []byte
    golden.Assert(t, "render", got) // vs testdata/render.golden
}
```

- Fixtures live in the test package's own `testdata/` directory, named
  `<case>.golden` (the `name` passed to `Assert`).
- Regenerate after an intended change with the package-level `-update` flag,
  then review and commit the diff:

  ```sh
  go test ./internal/foo -run TestRender -update
  ```

`internal/golden` and its `golden_test.go` are the worked example.
